# Learning to use RxJs for potential use in Project Open.

I have to code to learn.

This first attempt adapts some code from [Handling complex mouse and touch events with RxJS](https://codepen.io/HunorMarton/post/handling-complex-mouse-and-touch-events-with-rxjs) by bringing it up to the current version of RxJs and adding a bit of hacked up testing code. I couldn't get any of the official testing approaches to work so I hacked my own.
